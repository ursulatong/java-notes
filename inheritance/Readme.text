1. Inheritance in Java
    Inheritance is a relation between two classes, the parent and child class. 
    The child class (sub-class) inherits all the properties of the parent class (super-class). 
    To define the relation, we use extends keyword

2. 
Java does not support the multiple inheritance because of the diamond problem.
